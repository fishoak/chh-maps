Marion would do much of the housework, so theirs was reputedly the first village house built without a maid's room. \n \n Jared Newman was much impressed with his son and daughter-in-law's home, designed by Ithaca architect LeRoy Burnham, so much so that he turned his attention to the building of smaller homes a bit farther north in the Village from the original section where his own grand house stood at the intersection of Highland Road and The Parkway. Smaller and cheaper housing, he hoped, would not mean \"Cheap John\" designs; his solution was the development he called Klinewoods, beginning in 1932. (Notable Architecture, Village History)",

Since that time, most garages have been changed to face the street, and many have been expanded to fit two cars and now, recycling bins. \n \n Of living in this area in the 1930s, Marcham writes in his account, \"Memories of Cayuga Heights, N.Y.,\" of a \"typical Cayuga Heights Street\": \"My wife and I had chosen a place in Oak Hill Road that would allow our children a half mile walk to school and give me a one mile walk to the Cornell campus. For the walk I had friends; two of my neighbors joined me in walking, and one of them, like myself, owned no car....Their wives walked down Oak Hill Road westward to Highland Road and then south to the bus stop on Thurston Avenue. For a time, in the 1930s, milkmen and men who delivered ice, and the leading grocers in Ithaca, allowed us to order goods and brought them to us and to other persons around the City of Ithaca. If you were sick you would not go to the doctor; he or she came to you, the doctor with the little black bag. And once or twice a year the coalman came and poured tons of coal down a chute into your cellar.\" (Village History)",

        "Notes": "The home of the Village's all-volunteer fire department, the station was named to honor the late mayor Ron Anderson because of his leadership during its design and construction. The Department's founding membership in 1955 was drawn from local workers and from Cornell faculty. Today, an innovative \"bunker\" program allows some members, usually Cornell or Ithaca College students, to live in second floor dormitory rooms rent-free in exchange for firefighting and emergency medical treatment services. This unique arrangement is one way the Department is able to maintain the fastest response time among area volunteer departments, two to three minutes. \n \n A memorial to the 9/11 firefighters, a garden in front of the station designed and donated by the Cayuga Heights Garden Club, is a peaceful reminder of the brave men and women who serve our country and our Village.

        "Concatenation": "194 Pleasant Grove Rd Cayuga Heights Fire Department 2003   Contemporary The home of the Village's all-volunteer fire department, the station was named to honor the late mayor Ron Anderson because of his leadership during its design and construction. The Department's founding membership in 1955 was drawn from local workers and from Cornell faculty. Today, an innovative \"bunker\" program allows some members, usually Cornell or Ithaca College students, to live in second floor dormitory rooms rent-free in exchange for firefighting and emergency medical treatment services. This unique arrangement is one way the Department is able to maintain the fastest response time among area volunteer departments, two to three minutes. \n \n A memorial to the 9/11 firefighters, a garden in front of the station designed and donated by the Cayuga Heights Garden Club, is a peaceful reminder of the brave men and women who serve our country and our Village.

        "Notes": "This Gustav Stickley home was built for the Peer family. After Franklin Sherman Peer's death in 1922, his wife Harriet lived in the home with their son Sherman Peer, his wife Eleanor, and their two children. Sherman was an Ithaca lawyer active in village social and political affairs. He was best man for his friend Robert E. Treman, who married actress Irene Castle. The Tremans settled nearby at Greystone. Sherman, a 1906 Cornell grad, later served as Cornell provost for external affairs. \n \n The original address of the Peer home was 401 Highland Road but later became known as 2 Parkway Place. It was the first Stickley home in Ithaca and clearly reflects the Craftsman style of architecture. It is one of three grand residences marking The Parkway and Highland Road corner at the entrance to Cayuga Heights, the other two being the house built by Jared Newman at 9 Parkway Place and 104 The Parkway, built by J.H. Tanner, the Village's first treasurer (see a photograph taken of the three homes in about 1916 in former village historian Carol Sisler's book, Enterprising Families). In 1949, Sherman Peer sold 2 Parkway Place to James and Diana Rothschild, who owned the popular Rothschild's Department Store downtown on the Ithaca Commons from the turn of the century until 1980.

Planted in sandy soil, the many iris varieties dazzled visitors in late spring, and village residents bought iris plants for their home gardens from the iris experts."

A variant of a Usonian home, such homes are distinguished by their small size and are generally single-story dwellings on inexpensive sites. A flat roof and natural lighting provided by clerestory windows provide a strong visual connection between the interior and exterior spaces. Designed and owned by Cornell architecture professor Alexander Kira, the home adheres to Miesian design principles. This minimalist aesthetic was evident in the two homes he designed for himself in Cayuga Heights (the other has since been replaced). Those who had occasion to visit recalled that he and his wife, Marian, were always proud to show off the many special features of these houses. Storage compartments were designed to accommodate specific items such as wine glasses, placemats, or socks. The interiors were always comfortable, clean, properly arranged and camera ready.

In 1963, the university purchased the house, and Cornell President James Perkins and family moved in. The change of the president's residence from 205 Oak Hill Road may have been occasioned by the university administration's wish to move farther from campus, out of easy reach by students, given an incident at the 205 Oak Hill address in 1958.\n \n The half-timbered house is built of locally quarried Llenroc (Cornell spelled backwards) stone and stucco, with leaded glass windows, large and small slate roof tiles, and copper water pipes, indicating the high-quality standards used. A monument to the pre-Depression era, the house boasts 9,000 square feet, has seventeen rooms, nine fireplaces, eight bathrooms, and closets as large as entire rooms. \n (Notable Architecture)",

As Newman intended, the central location added to the attraction of Cayuga Heights for families with children. Named for its beloved first principal, Miss Martha Hitchcock, Hitchcock Hall was the forerunner of the Cayuga Heights Elementary School. It was a beautiful, rambling Tudor-style building in a park-like setting. Sadly, the era of urban renewal brought its demolition and replacement by the Ithaca City School District in 1969 with the current, much more generic building, which has been added on to since. \n \n In 1980, enrollment decline caused the Ithaca City School District to close the school. Disappointed villagers responded with the formation of a Cayuga Heights Community Association under the leadership of Betty Matyas, who lived next door to the school. Tenants were found, including a Montessori school, to keep the building viable, and when enrollments climbed back up, the school was reopened in 1988 for both village children and those bussed from West Hill. In 1995, the large number of older adults who sold their homes and moved to Kendal at Ithaca flooded the real estate market with houses that young families proved eager to purchase, and so, once again the school was bursting at the seams.

The Greek Revival house was finished the following year. Charles Williams had come to Ithaca in 1905 as the division freight agent for the Lehigh Valley Railroad. He later established the Williams Electric Company. In 1942, the Williams's niece, Dorothy Knight Knox Holden, sold the house to Edward R. and Bergljot Audhild Sanne Martinez Ybor. Edward was the grandson of Vicente Martinez Ybor, the Cigar King of Ybor City, Florida. The Ybors renovated the home in 1946. For the garden, Norwegian-born Audhild Sanne designed a \"Little Europe\" of stone bridges and castles in the backyard, which she had a Cornell engineering student and stone mason construct. The structures, which were built from reclaimed stone from a downtown building that had been torn down, reminded her of Europe. (Notable Architecture)",
